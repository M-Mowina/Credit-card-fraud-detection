# Credit-card-fraud-detection
 Credit Card Fraud Detection In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of a credit card transactions dataset to detect fraudulent activities. The workflow included:  Data Analysis and Visualization: Explored and visualized key features to understand patterns and imbalances in the data.  Data Preprocessing: Handled class imbalance, normalized features, and prepared the dataset for modeling.  Modeling with SVM: Built and fine-tuned a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for fraud detection.  Results: Achieved a 90% F1-score, demonstrating strong performance in identifying fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.  This project highlights the importance of thorough data analysis and careful model selection in tackling imbalanced classification problems like fraud detection.
